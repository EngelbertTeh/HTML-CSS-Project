	<div><h2>History of Computers</h2></div>
    <div>
	  <p>
		 Before gadgets and machines, calculations were done by hand, and the very first computers were non other than humans.
		 Back then, the word <b>computer</b> actually referred to the people who did scientific calculations by hand. Then came devices
		 such as the <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">abacus</a> that aided men in their calculations for at least 5000 years. 
		 As technology advances, mechanical computers were developed to aid in crunching more sophisticated calculations.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
		 By 1837, Englishman, Charles Babbage had come up with an idea that computer could understand commands and could be programmed. 
		 Based on this idea, he would go on to build the machine called 
		 <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine#:~:text=The%20Analytical%20Engine%20was%20a,for%20a%20simpler%20mechanical%20calculator."> Analytical Engine </a>, 
		 and it was the first machine ever designed with the idea of programming.
		 His design highlighted the characteristics of modern computers: 
	  </p>
	  
	  <ol>
	    <li>An input device</li>
		<li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
		<li>A processor or number calculator</li>
		<li>A unit to control the task and the sequence of its calculations</li>
		<li>An output device</li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  <p>This design concept soon became the blueprint that soon lead to the development of the digital computers as we know them today!</p>

		<h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
		  
		<p>
		  Sitting at the helm of modern day computers, it's none other than the <a  class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">Central Processing Unit</a>, or commonly known by the abbreviation CPU.
		  The CPU main functions are as follows: 
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Performing basic arithmetic operations</li>
		  <li>Performing logical operations</li>
		  <li>Performing input/output operations</li>
		  <li>Act as a controlling unit by directing the flow of operations</li>
		</ul>

	    <h3>Keyboard and Mouse</h3>
		
		<p>A <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard">keyboard</a> is a peripheral device that enables users to input text into a computer.</p>
		
		<p>Having the same arrangement of the alphabetical keys as its predecessor, the manual typewriter, 
		   the keyboard does more than just being a device for typing: its basically an interface for users 
		   to <i>"communicate"</i> with their computers.
		</p>
		<div><img alt="keyboard" src="images/keyboard.png"></div>
		
		<p>
		  A <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse">mouse</a> on the other hand is 
		  a hand-held input device that controls the cursor on our computer screens.
		  More than that, whenever the mouse button is being clicked, electronic signals will be sent to the CPU 
		  where it will decide on what operations to be carried out basing on the cursor's location on the screen.
		</p>

	    <h3>Computer Screen</h3>
		
		<p>
		  Computer screen, either a <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor">monitor</a> or a laptop screen, 
		  is an output device that displays information in pictorial or text form.
		  The first invented computer monitors were the cathode ray tube monitors, also known as <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube">CRT.</a> 
		  In the early 2010s, the switch to LCD monitors from CRT displays was gradual but inevitable. Then came LED and OLED monitors, like their predecessor, gradually taking
		  over the display market.

	    <h3>Hard Drive and Solid State Drive</h3>
		
		<p>These are <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://www.javatpoint.com/secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization">secondary storage devices</a> 
		   of computers, where the CPU does not have direct access to the data stored. Two common secondary storages
		   are the <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">Hard Drive</a> and 
		   <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid State Drive(SSD).</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>These devices store data inside the computer and ensure data are kept long term and not wiped off even after the power supply is shut off.</p>

	    <h3>Random Access Memory Device</h3>
		
		<p><a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>, also known as Random Access Memory, is a form of computer memory
		   that allows reading and writing data items fast, like very fast, compared to the hard drive or SSD.
		   The hardware that made all this possible is non other than the RAM device, available in two forms either 
		   <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://www.atpinc.com/blog/computer-memory-types-dram-ram-module">SRAM or DRAM.</a>
		   
		<p>RAM is a form of primary memory storage where data items are directly accessible to the CPU.
		   Data memory stored in RAM devices are volatile, in other words, data will be wiped off when its power supply is shut off.
		   Hence the reason why RAM devices are used essentially for storing short term memory where data is stored as and when the processor needs it.

	    <h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>
		
		<p>The Graphics Processing Unit also known as <a class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a>, 
		   is a specialized electronic circuit designed to accelerate the formation of images on the display screen.
		</p>
		
		<p> In the past, GPUs are mainly used for gaming, image rendering, video editing, cryptomining, and more recently, GPUs are used in machine learning.</p>

	    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
		
		<p>Last but not least, the <a  class="link" rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">motherboard</a> being equally as important as the CPU,<br> 
		   acts as a housing unit, providing sockets for components such as the CPU, harddrive, <br>
		   RAM, external ports, etc, integrating and connecting the electrical circuitry between them.
